## Basic Components Description : 
1. World map : There are two maps. The first map is a tutorial with basic instructions. The second one is a normal map with a hidden ending. The camera moves with the player and goes smoothly. The background will move according to the player's position and it moves relatively slow so that the scene would appear to be 3D.

2. Player : The player has normal physics properties. They can move with arrow keys and and jump with up arrow or space. The player will die and respawn when getting hit by enemies or fall down holes on the map. The respawn location will be on the right of the death location so that the player won't fall in a dying loop when touching a stationery enemy (die -> respawn on enemy ->die)
